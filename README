Voltage and Electric field visualizer
E and M project by Berit Johnson

Requires Python and Python Visual to be installed

Run em1.py to run

Capabilities:

Able to add or remove arbitrary point or line charges where both line position and line charge density may be defined parametrically

Both point and line charges may be changed and affect the field accordingly

Point charges may be dragged in field and affect the field accordingly

Able to calculate voltage at any given point in terms of k= 1/(4 pi e0)

Able to display voltage field and electric field in three dimensional space
